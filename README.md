# En: Automobile Market Data Analysis Project üèéÔ∏è

## Description
This project is proposed by the "Soy Henry" Data Science Bootcamp and focuses on data analysis of a data set containing information about different car models, including details on technical characteristics, prices, and more. We will simulate a situation where we have been hired in the data science team at a renowned consulting firm. We have been assigned to a market research project for a major Chinese automaker. The main objective is to analyze the characteristics of the vehicles present in the data set provided to know what characteristics high-end and low-end vehicles have on the market, in order to cover all target audiences, adjusting to all demand and, Based on this data, be able to correctly quote the vehicles that will be offered. For this purpose, predictive models will be developed to estimate the prices of the vehicles and classify them if they are expensive or cheap.

## Notebooks

1. **cars_ETL.ipynb:** Data exploration and cleaning process.
2. **cars_EDA.ipynb:** Feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
3. **cars_modeling.ipynb:** Implementation and evaluation of predictive models.

## Overview

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
We begin by loading and exploring the dataset, followed by meticulous modifications and cleaning procedures, adhering to predefined criteria aimed at addressing the problem at hand.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ensues, leveraging statistical tools to unearth optimal features for use in our models. The data is meticulously prepared to facilitate the deployment of classification and predictive models.

### Model Training
The selected models undergo training to accomplish specific tasks:

1. Prediction:
- Linear Regression

2. Classification:

- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

### Model Evaluation and Selection
Post-training, models are fine-tuned through hyperparameter calibration. A thorough comparison is conducted to make informed decisions, ensuring the selection of the most effective model for the given problem.

## Installation

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, among others. You can install them by running.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
