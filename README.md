# En: Automobile Market Data Analysis Project üèéÔ∏è

## Description
The project is comprehensive market study for a leading Chinese automotive company entering a new market, analysing vehicle characteristics to distinguish between high-end and low-end models and optimizing pricing strategies. Tasks included collecting and processing vehicle price and feature data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into market trends, and developing and deploying predictive models using supervised machine learning techniques. Leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data pre-processing and cleaning, along with machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression. Utilized Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Database for efficient storage and processing of large volumes of data, enhancing scalability and performance. Successfully delivered predictive models for price classification and prediction, enabling informed decision-making for market entry and pricing strategies.

## Notebooks

1. **cars_ETL.ipynb:** Data exploration and cleaning process.
2. **cars_EDA.ipynb:** Feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
3. **cars_modeling.ipynb:** Implementation and evaluation of predictive models.

## Overview

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
We begin by loading and exploring the dataset, followed by meticulous modifications and cleaning procedures, adhering to predefined criteria aimed at addressing the problem at hand.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ensues, leveraging statistical tools to unearth optimal features for use in our models. The data is meticulously prepared to facilitate the deployment of classification and predictive models.

### Model Training
The selected models undergo training to accomplish specific tasks:

1. Prediction:
- Linear Regression

2. Classification:

- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

### Model Evaluation and Selection
Post-training, models are fine-tuned through hyperparameter calibration. A thorough comparison is conducted to make informed decisions, ensuring the selection of the most effective model for the given problem.

## Installation

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, among others. You can install them by running.
